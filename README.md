# MathematicalParser
# Created by Alexander Russell
This Mathematical Parser is a very easy to use and implement into a project.
In order to use this parser 
just create a new instance of the MathmaticalTree class
call MathmaticalTree.initWithFormula(formula: String) // this will return the root node of the tree
The root node is of type ExpressionNode this class has a method printNodeAndChildren() this method will print the node and everything below it in the tree.
