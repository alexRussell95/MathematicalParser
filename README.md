# Mathematical Parser for Swift
# Created by Alexander Russell
This is a Mathematical Parser for the Swift language.
USE:
    let mathTree = MathmaticalTree()
    let start = mathTree.initWithFormula("( 3 + 7 ) * ( 4 + x )")
    start.printNodeAndChildren("", isTail: true)
This will print the entire tree.

This project was deisigned out of the need to get an Abstract Syntax Tree for mathematical strings in the swift language.

If there are any question, comments, or ideas to help improve this parser please visit or join the google group Mathematical-Parser-Swift-Dev
